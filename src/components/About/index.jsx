    <p>
      Hi, I&apos;m Chris, I&apos;m a full stack developer working at&nbsp;
      <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a>
      &nbsp;in Barcelona. I always like trying new tech stacks but I&apos;m
      usually happy working with Node.js, React, Clojure and AWS. Apart from
      this I have experience with CI/CD, agile methodologies and I am very
      passionate about infrastructure and helping teams grow a strong DevOps
      culture. Outside of tech I also enjoy surfing and swimming in my freetime.
