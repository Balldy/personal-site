    <p>
      Hi, I&apos;m Chris, I&apos;m a full stack developer working at&nbsp;
      <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">Thoughtworks</a>
      &nbsp;in Barcelona. I always like trying new tech stacks but I&apos;m
      usually happy working with Node.js, React, Java or Clojure. As well as
      this I have experience with CI/CD, agile methodologies, cloud
      infrastructure and I am very passionate about growing a strong DevOps
      culture on the teams I&apos;m part of. Outside of tech I like surfing and
      swimming in my freetime.
